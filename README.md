# Spring Coding Challenge: URL shortener

You have probably heard, or even used, a URL shortener (like [bit.ly](https://bit.ly) or [goo.gl](https://goo.gl)) before. Basically, they allow a user to submit a long URL and create a much shorter URL that can be easily typed and used forever. Given the following user stories, your challenge is to implement a URL shortener API (no GUI needed):

> As a User, I want to shorten a long URL so that I can share and easily remember the URL

> As a User, when I visit the shortened version of the URL, I want to be taken to the original URL

## How to submit your solution
Please follow these directions as they affect our ability to evaluate your submission.

1. Fork this repo
2. Implement your solution and **push to your fork**
3. When you are finished, email a link to [platform-engineers@outcomehealth.com](mailto:platform-engineers@outcomehealth.com)

## What we want to see
This challenge is your opportunity to show how you work. Here are some things we will be looking for:

1. Code that is readable, well organized, and easily understood
2. Code that follows Java/Spring style conventions
3. Code that is well tested
4. Tests that are focused and readable
5. That you followed the directions in this README

## How we will evaluate your solution

1. Run `gradle build` to see that your solution compiles
2. Run your app in IntellijIDEA to see that it builds and runs
3. Make some requests to your application
4. Inspect the code for readability, style, and completeness
5. Inspect the tests for readability, style, and comprehensiveness
6. Write some more tests to see if we can break anything

It's really that straight forward, there are no hidden gotchas or trick questions.
